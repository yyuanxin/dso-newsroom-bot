## Create s3 bucket to store cached data
Used to store cached data of the latest releases. (Currently used for gitlab only)
Use Case: For sites with no timestamps. Eg: `2023-02-14T00:00:00+00:00`

1. Create a s3 bucket `rss-code`
2. Update cached.txt with the latest data
3. Upload cached.txt to `rss-code` bucket

## Deploy to Lambda

1. Create a python3.9 lambda function
2. Run `script.sh` locally and upload output file `python-package.zip`
3. Create 3 environment variables
   - Key: BOT_TOKEN
     Value: <telegram-bot-token>
   - Key: CHANNEL_ID
     Value: <telegram-channel-id>
   - Key: HOURS
     Value: <how-often-bot-checks-for-new-releases>

## Set Daily cron job with EventBridge

1. Create new recurring schedule (rate-based)
2. Set rate expression to match with `HOURS` environment variable set in Lambda
